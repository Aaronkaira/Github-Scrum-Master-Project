# Velocity & Delivery Predictability

## Purpose

Velocity and predictability metrics provide leadership with **confidence in delivery timelines** and help teams improve planning accuracy over time.

---

## Velocity Tracking

* Velocity tracked per team across sprints
* Trends reviewed over multiple sprints (not in isolation)
* Used for forecasting, not performance evaluation

---

## Predictability Formula

```
Predictability % = (Completed Story Points / Committed Story Points) x 100
```

---

## Interpretation Guidelines

* **90–100%:** Healthy and predictable delivery
* **70–89%:** Moderate risk; refinement or capacity issues
* **<70%:** High risk; root cause analysis required

---

## Common Risk Indicators

* Frequent sprint carryover
* Over-commitment
* High BAU intrusion
* Dependency delays

---

## Scrum Master Actions

* Improve backlog readiness
* Enforce DoR and ticket standards
* Adjust sprint commitments
* Escalate dependency risks early

---

## Outcome

Over time, teams achieve:

* Stable velocity
* Increased delivery confidence
* Reduced unplanned work impact
