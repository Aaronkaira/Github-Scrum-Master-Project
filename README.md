# End-to-End Agile Delivery & Jira Governance

### Scrum Master Case Study (Cybersecurity Platform)

## Overview

This repository is a **hands-on Scrum Master delivery case study** designed to demonstrate Agile execution, Jira governance, KPI reporting, and cross-functional collaboration in a real-world enterprise-style environment.

The project simulates delivery for a **cybersecurity learning and risk-awareness platform**, aligned to regulated, security-conscious organizations. The focus is not on software development itself, but on **how a Scrum Master enables predictable, high-quality delivery through disciplined Agile practices**.

---

## Project Objectives

* Demonstrate **end-to-end Agile delivery** from initiation to execution
* Showcase **Jira governance and ticket quality standards**
* Track and report **Agile KPIs** for leadership visibility
* Manage **project and BAU workstreams** concurrently
* Reinforce Agile best practices and continuous improvement

---

## Role: Scrum Master

In this case study, I act as the **Scrum Master and Agile Delivery Lead**, responsible for:

* Facilitating all Scrum ceremonies (Planning, Standups, Reviews, Retrospectives)
* Owning **Jira workflow governance and ticket standards**
* Ensuring backlog readiness and prioritization
* Tracking sprint performance and delivery metrics
* Reporting insights, risks, and trends to stakeholders
* Coaching teams to improve Agile maturity and consistency

---

## Team & Delivery Context

* Cross-functional delivery team (Developers, QA, Product Owner, Business Stakeholders)
* Remote-first collaboration
* Mixed workload:

  * **Project delivery** (new cybersecurity platform features)
  * **BAU work** (defects, enhancements, operational requests)

---

## Tools & Artifacts

* **Jira** – Sprint execution, backlog management, workflows, reporting
* **Confluence** – Agile documentation and team standards
* **GitHub** – Delivery artifacts and governance documentation
* **AWS (conceptual)** – High-level platform architecture context

## Agile Governance Highlights

* Clearly defined **Definition of Ready** and **Definition of Done**
* Standardized Jira ticket structure:

  * Acceptance criteria
  * Story points
  * Dependencies
  * Labels and impacted systems
* Explicit **BAU vs Project** triage and prioritization rules
* Workflow enforcement to ensure clean, actionable backlogs

---

## KPIs & Reporting

The following metrics are tracked and reviewed each sprint:

* Sprint velocity
* Delivery predictability
* Cycle time
* Backlog health
* Defect ratio
* Capacity vs commitment

Sprint summaries and leadership reports highlight:

* Delivery trends
* Risks and impediments
* Improvement opportunities

---

## Continuous Improvement

Retrospectives focus on:

* Process efficiency
* Collaboration effectiveness
* Delivery bottlenecks
* Actionable improvements carried into subsequent sprints

---

## Purpose of This Case Study

This project exists to demonstrate **how a Scrum Master operates in practice**, particularly in environments that require:

* Strong governance
* Delivery discipline
* Transparent reporting
* Collaboration across business and technology

It reflects real-world Agile delivery scenarios commonly found in **cloud and cybersecurity-adjacent organizations**.
