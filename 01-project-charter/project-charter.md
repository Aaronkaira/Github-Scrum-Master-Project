Project Charter
End-to-End Agile Delivery & Jira Governance – Scrum Master Case Study
Project Name

Cybersecurity Learning & Risk Awareness Platform

Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to deliver a scalable cybersecurity learning and awareness platform while demonstrating disciplined Agile delivery across multiple Scrum teams. The initiative requires strong Jira governance, backlog management, dependency tracking, and KPI reporting to ensure predictable and transparent delivery.

This case study focuses on how a Scrum Master enables delivery excellence, rather than on the technical implementation itself.

Clear Definition of Ready and Definition of Done

Explicit BAU vs Project ticket classification

Key Risks & Mitigation Strategies
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Cross-team dependency delays	Missed sprint goals	Dependency mapping and early refinement
Scope creep from stakeholders	Delivery predictability loss	Strict backlog prioritization and change control
Inconsistent ticket quality	Sprint churn	Jira governance enforcement
Capacity overload due to BAU	Reduced velocity	Capacity planning and BAU allocation limits
Environment readiness delays	Blocked delivery	Early coordination with Cloud team
Success Metrics

Stable sprint velocity across teams

Improved delivery predictability

Reduced carryover between sprints

Healthy backlog with refinement readiness

Transparent leadership reporting

Stakeholders
Business Stakeholders

Agile Delivery Leadership

Assumptions

Teams operate with shared Agile standards

Jira is the single source of truth

Leadership supports Agile governance enforcement

Metrics are used for improvement, not micro-management

Approval

This charter establishes the foundation for disciplined, multi-team Agile delivery and serves as the baseline for backlog creation, sprint execution, and KPI reporting throughout the project lifecycle.
