# Definition of Ready (DoR)

## Purpose

The Definition of Ready (DoR) ensures that work entering a sprint is **clear, prioritized, sized, and actionable**. It protects teams from sprint churn, mid-sprint scope changes, and unclear requirements, enabling predictable delivery.

No work item may be pulled into a sprint unless it meets **all DoR criteria**.

---

## DoR Criteria

A Jira ticket is considered **Ready** when:

### 1. Clear Description

* Business context and purpose are clearly stated
* Problem or opportunity is well understood
* Scope boundaries are defined

---

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Defined

* Acceptance criteria are documented in clear, testable statements
* Criteria describe *what success looks like*
* No ambiguity remains for developers or QA

---

### 3. Prioritized by Product Owner

* Ticket priority is agreed and visible
* Ticket aligns with sprint goals and roadmap
* Trade-offs against other work are understood

---

### 4. Estimated & Sized

* Story points are assigned by the team
* Estimation is agreed during refinement
* Ticket size fits within sprint capacity guidelines

---

### 5. Dependencies Identified

* All known dependencies are documented
* Cross-team dependencies are flagged and tracked
* Blockers are visible and actively managed

---

### 6. BAU vs Project Classification

* Ticket is clearly labeled as:

  * **Project**
  * **BAU / Operational**
* BAU tickets have agreed priority and capacity allocation

---

### 7. Jira Governance Compliance

* Mandatory Jira fields completed:

  * Acceptance criteria
  * Story points
  * Labels (Team, Impacted System)
  * Sprint readiness status
* Ticket follows agreed naming and structure standards

---

## Not Ready Indicators

A ticket is **NOT READY** if:

* Acceptance criteria are missing or unclear
* Priority is not agreed
* Dependencies are unknown
* The ticket cannot be estimated
* Business value is unclear

Such tickets must remain in the **Backlog / Refinement** state.

---

## Ownership

* **Product Owner:** Content clarity and prioritization
* **Scrum Master:** Governance enforcement and readiness validation
* **Team:** Estimation and dependency identification

---

## Outcome

Consistent application of the DoR leads to:

* Reduced sprint carryover
* Improved delivery predictability
* Higher-quality sprint commitments
